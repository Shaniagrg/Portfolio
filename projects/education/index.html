I want to be independent woman who can support her family financially.I knew the only thing that would bring change in our life is education. Coming from a low income family it’s hard to fit into a lot of places. I have seen my parents struggling to do all paperwork by themselves due to lack of education. I realized education is important in order to make life easier.
