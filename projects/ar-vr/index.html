                <p>
                    In conducting user research, we tried to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by hotel guests and their expectations regarding engagement with hotel services. Through surveys, interviews, and observational studies, we discovered that many customers often felt overlooked and uninformed about the availability of complimentary hotel amenities until after their stay had concluded. Sometimes customer also felt overlooked and uninformed about the availability of complimentary hotel amenities until after their stay had concluded. This lack of awareness led to a sense of disconnection and missed opportunities for engagement during their visit. Furthermore, guests expressed a desire for more interactive and immersive experiences that would enhance their overall stay. These insights guided our approach in designing an AR solution aimed at addressing these pain points and creating a more welcoming and engaging experience for hotel guests.

However, upon check-in, I find myself faced with the inconvenience of having to inquire about these amenities, which can be time-consuming and disrupt my already busy schedule. I often wish there was a more efficient solution, like a hotel app, that could seamlessly guide me to the amenities I desire without any delays or hassle.

                    This project taught me the value of integrating intuitive AR features to streamline user navigation and improve their experience. I learned how essential it is to provide clear visual guidance and minimize the need for external assistance, making technology both practical and engaging for users.
