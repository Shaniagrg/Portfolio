                    Understanding User
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In conducting user research, we tried to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by hotel guests and their expectations regarding engagement with hotel services. Through surveys, interviews, and observational studies, we discovered that many customers often felt overlooked and uninformed about the availability of complimentary hotel amenities until after their stay had concluded. Sometimes customer also felt overlooked and uninformed about the availability of complimentary hotel amenities until after their stay had concluded. This lack of awareness led to a sense of disconnection and missed opportunities for engagement during their visit. Furthermore, guests expressed a desire for more interactive and immersive experiences that would enhance their overall stay. These insights guided our approach in designing an AR solution aimed at addressing these pain points and creating a more welcoming and engaging experience for hotel guests.
