                <p>
                    I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research was busy working adults who doesn’t have fixed time to prepare or eat meals.This user group confirmed initial assumptions about customers, but through this research we also found that user were facing challenges in determining portion sizes when buying groceries. Many users struggle to estimate their consumption accurately, leading to either food waste or frequent trips to the market.Due to the lack of culinary skills most of the food go to waste even when ordering online. Other user problems included time consumption, interests, or busy schedule that make it difficult to get groceries for cooking or go to restaurants in-person. Moreover, 90% of our users with whom we conducted research expressed frustration with inconsistent portion sizes when ordering food online, leading to either dissatisfaction or food wastage, resulting in regret.Overall, these insights underscore the importance of addressing the specific needs and challenges of busy working adults in the design of our takeout app.

                            The third usability study revealed frustration with no order status option after the order was successful. To streamline this flow, I added order status and back to home at same page.

                            While designing the Take out app, I learned that the first ideas for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the app’s designs
