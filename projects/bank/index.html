                <p>
                    Traditional banking websites are overwhelming and confusing to navigate, which frustrated many target users leading to frustration and high drop off rates. Hence, I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better understand the target user and their needs. I conducted research with 5 users and it revealed that 80% struggled with tracking their transactions, highlighting a significant pain point in the current banking experience.

                    I discovered that many target users want easy and fast way to transfer money from any location.
