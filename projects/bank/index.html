                    Traditional banking websites are overwhelming and confusing to navigate, which frustrated many target users leading to frustration and high drop off rates. Hence, I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better understand the target user and their needs. I conducted research with 5 users and it revealed that 80% struggled with tracking their transactions, highlighting a significant pain point in the current banking experience.

                    I discovered that many target users want easy and fast way to transfer money from any location.

                        To address user pain points related to tracking updates, browsing, and checkout flow, I started by sketching out paper wireframes for the screen in my app. These initial designs allowed me to visualize and iterate on the user experience early in the development process. For the home screen, I explored multiple variations, each focusing on optimizing the browsing experience. This iterative approach ensured that the final design would be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to the needs of the bank's customers.

This strategic approach was crucial in creating a user-friendly interface that meets the needs of the bank's customers.

One of the changes I made was adding small text and a button on the side of the image so that it’s easier for user to navigate. This allowed users more freedom to browse the other services provided by bank while transfering.
